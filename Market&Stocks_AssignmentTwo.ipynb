            "I think one of the best performing commodities this year will be Silver. The metal has a unique combination of industrial utility and precious metal appeal. Unlike gold, which is primarily a store of value, silver has extensive industrial demand, accounting for over 50% of its annual consumption. As of 2023, global silver demand reached approximately **1.2 billion ounces**, driven by sectors such as electronics, solar energy, automotive, and medical technology. Silver's conductivity makes it essential in everything from circuit boards and smartphones to electric vehicles and photovoltaic cells. Notably, demand from the solar industry alone hit a record **161 million ounces in 2023**, reflecting its critical role in the transition to renewable energy. This growing industrial need places upward pressure on prices, especially as global policies increasingly favor green technologies. The US might not be so green the next four years but the rest of the world certainly is. Samsung also recently had a break through in its solid state battery development that will use a silver-carbon layer, if others follow this could be a game changer for electric cars and their range. Samsung is set to start production this year. \n",
            "\n",
            "On the supply side, silver production has struggled to keep pace with rising demand. Global mine production in 2023 was about **820 million ounces**, creating a notable supply deficit. This marks several consecutive years of shortfall, leading to draw downs in above-ground inventories. Many silver-producing mines are aging, and new discoveries are becoming rarer and more expensive to develop. In addition to its industrial use, silver retains monetary value and is seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation—particularly attractive during times of economic uncertainty. This dual role, as both a commodity and a financial asset, makes silver a compelling addition to a diversified investment portfolio, Silver and Gold have always been paired together and the ratio has been way off recently. Gold has had a fantastic run this year which surprised everyone, even Warren Buffett probably. In 1998 Buffett announced he purchased 130M ounces of silver with the idea demand will pick up. He had the right idea but he was too early, electric cars, solar, batteries and cell phones weren't in their prime growth period. If central banks start adding silver to their vaults, watch out. \n",

The BIS ratio requires banks to maintain at least 8% of their loan assets as capital, whereas SLR demands a minimum of 3% capital for non-loan assets. These rules are designed to prevent banks from taking on excessive risk. The 1997 Asian financial crisis, where many Korean banks collapsed due to unrecoverable loans, underscores why such safeguards matter.\n",

The 2023 U.S. regional banking crisis was a textbook example: 30-year Treasuries lost half their value from their peak, and when deposit withdrawals surged, banks lacked the liquidity to cover them. Short-term Treasuries, controlled by the Federal Reserve’s rate policies, pose less risk but offer minimal profit, making them less appealing to banks. **How banks handle long-term Treasuries thus becomes a critical factor in financial stability**.\n",

We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely).

However, Volatility can offer opportunities for significant gains, but it can also lead to devastating losses if investors are unprepared for the magnified downturns.\n",

            "# What Are Leverage ETFs?\n",
            "\n",
            "Leverage ETFs are investment vehicles that combine stocks and futures, aiming to track the daily returns of an underlying asset by a multiple of two or more. In the U.S., where the options market outshines the stock futures market, leverage ETFs rely on synthetic futures rather than actual futures. A synthetic future is constructed by buying a call option and selling a put option with the same strike price, mimicking the behavior of a futures contract. These transactions are facilitated through swap agreements, specifically Total Return Swaps (TRS), enabling the ETF to pursue leveraged returns on the underlying asset\n",
            "\n",
            "# How Daily Rebalancing Works\n",
            "\n",
            "A defining trait of leverage ETFs is their mandate to deliver at least double the daily return of the underlying asset. This requires constant adjustment of their synthetic futures positions in response to price changes. For instance, if Tesla’s stock plummets by 50% on December 18, 2024, TSLL—a leverage ETF tracking Tesla—would see its value approach zero if it failed to adjust its holdings. To avoid this, TSLL must reduce its synthetic futures position when Tesla’s price drops and increase it when the price rises, ensuring the daily 2x leverage target is met.\n",
            "\n",
            "This adjustment process may not pose significant issues in short-term scenarios involving sharp declines followed by swift recoveries. Take 2022 as an example: a market crash followed by a rapid rebound limits the losses from rebalancing, keeping the \"negative compounding effect\" in check. In such cases, the erosion of the ETF’s value remains less pronounced.\n",

            "# Risks in Volatile Markets\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the story shifts dramatically in volatile, range-bound markets. If Tesla’s stock oscillates daily with 10% gains and losses, TSLL must buy additional synthetic futures on up days and sell them on down days. This pattern of buying high and selling low repeats, swiftly eroding the ETF’s value.\n",
            "\n",
            "This mirrors how a leverage ETF reduces its synthetic futures exposure as the underlying asset declines. Unlike stocks, which can simply be held, leverage ETFs must actively manage futures positions, making them more vulnerable in prolonged downturns. If the synthetic futures’ leverage ratio reaches 20x, selling futures becomes critical to maintain the daily 2x tracking—failure to do so undermines the ETF’s objective.\n",
            "\n",
            "# Volatility, Time Decay, and Investment Strategy\n",
            "\n",
            "Option pricing, governed by the Black-Scholes model, hinges on volatility as a key determinant. While stock investors may not view volatility as embedded in price, options introduce the concept of time value. Leverage ETFs, utilizing options within synthetic futures, are thus subject to time decay. When the underlying asset moves sideways, this cost steadily chips away at returns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consequently, leverage ETFs hold the most promise in short-term, trending markets where clear directionality can amplify gains. In contrast, volatile, directionless markets amplify losses, underscoring the need for careful market analysis before investing. A focus on short-term strategies rather than long-term holding, coupled with an awareness of volatility’s impact, may offer a more prudent path for those considering these instruments.\n",

There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.

            "Alright, Reddit, buckle up because we’re diving into the absolute rollercoaster that is Trump’s tariff policy on semiconductors, spearheaded by his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This is a wild ride of mixed signals, market swings, and what smells like blatant manipulation to make billionaires richer while the rest of us get played. If you’re in the markets or just curious about how the sausage gets made in DC, you need to read this. Monday’s announcement is going to be a doozy, and I’m calling it now: we’re staring down a potential disaster for the semiconductor industry, a textbook bull trap, and some seriously shady insider trading vibes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s start with the Friday bombshell. On April 11, 2025, the **Trump administration** dropped a *memo* that had Wall Street doing cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and a bunch of other electronics were exempted from the massive “reciprocal” tariffs Trump slapped on China (we’re talking 125% levies—insane). The U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, and flat panel displays, all getting a free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, and NVIDIA went nuts. The S&amp;P 500 was already down 10% since Trump took office, so this felt like a lifeline. Futures soared, X was buzzing with “bull market confirmed” takes, and everyone thought we were headed for a recovery rally. I mean, who wouldn’t be bullish? It looked like Trump was giving Big Tech a massive break.\n",
            "\n",
            "But then, Sunday morning hits, and **Howard Lutnick** goes on ABC’s This Week and basically says, **“Psych!”** He clarified that those exemptions? Yeah, they’re *temporary.* Semiconductors and electronics are still getting hit with **“sector-specific”** tariffs in **“a month or two,”** tied to national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These aren’t negotiable, unlike the reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick’s exact words: “These are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.” Suddenly, the whole narrative flips. The Friday exemption wasn’t a win—it was a head fake. And now, Monday’s announcement is looming, where Trump’s expected to double down on these semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos for the industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s talk about why this is a big deal for semiconductors. The global chip supply chain is insanely complex. Most semiconductors are designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), and assembled or finished in places like China. If Trump slaps tariffs on chips coming from China—or worse, starts a national security probe that messes with the whole supply chain—prices are going to spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm are going to take a hit, not to mention downstream players like Apple, who assemble iPhones in China. Lutnick’s pushing this “re-shore to America” narrative, but building chip fabs in the U.S. takes years and billions of dollars. TSMC’s Arizona plant isn’t even fully online yet! In the meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, and consumers get stuck with pricier gadgets—or straight-up shortages.\n",

            "Now, let’s get to the bull trap. Friday’s exemption announcement was like **catnip for traders.** Everyone piled into tech stocks, thinking the tariff threat was gone. But Lutnick’s Sunday comments yanked the rug out. Posts on X were already screaming about it: “Yesterday’s exemptions weren’t surrender—they were a setup,” one user said. Another called it a “headline-driven market” where the administration is “steering price action.” If Monday’s announcement confirms heavy tariffs, those bullish bets from Friday are going to get crushed. We could see a brutal sell-off in semiconductor stocks, dragging the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 down with it. The market’s already been a mess—wildest swings since COVID, down 10% since January 20. This could be the trap that catches all the dip-buyers off guard.\n",
            "\n",
            "And here’s where it gets really ugly: the insider trading and market manipulation angle. Let’s rewind to April 9, when Trump posted on Truth Social, **“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,”** just hours before he announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries (except China). The S&amp;P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, and Trump Media’s stock shot up 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters aren’t buying it. They’re calling for SEC investigations, saying Trump’s post reeks of insider trading. Schiff’s letter to the White House asked who knew about the tariff pause beforehand and whether anyone traded on it. When Trump was asked when he decided on the pause, he was cagey: “Over the last few days… probably came together early this morning.” Yeah, right.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fast forward to this weekend’s semiconductor flip-flop, and it’s déjà vu. Friday’s exemption pumps the market, Lutnick’s Sunday reversal sets up a crash, and Monday’s announcement could be the knockout punch. The timing is too convenient. Billionaires like Bill Ackman, who’s been cozy with Trump but criticized tariffs, are probably sitting pretty, knowing the playbook. Meanwhile, retail traders who went all-in on Friday are about to get smoked. It’s not just Trump’s Truth Social posts—Lutnick’s been all over TV, hyping tariffs one day, backtracking the next. The mixed signals aren’t just chaotic; they’re starting to look deliberate. As one X post put it, “The biggest rally of the year would come on the day Lutnick gets fired.” That’s the vibe right now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why does this matter? Because semiconductors are the backbone of everything. Your phone, your car, your fridge—they all need chips. If Trump and Lutnick tank the industry with tariffs, it’s not just stock prices that suffer. Inflation’s already a worry (economists have been screaming about tariffs spiking prices), and chip shortages could make 2021’s supply chain mess look like a picnic. Plus, China’s not sitting still—they hiked their own tariffs to 125% on Friday and are “evaluating” Trump’s exemptions. This could spiral into a full-blown trade war, and guess who pays the price? Not the billionaires with their offshore accounts—us.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, what’s the play here? Brace yourself. Monday’s announcement could confirm tariffs that gut semiconductor stocks and ripple through tech. If you’re holding NVIDIA or TSMC, maybe hedge with some puts. Cash is king if the market tanks. And keep an eye on X and Truth Social—Trump’s posts are basically market signals now, legal or not. The bigger picture? This administration’s tariff policy is a clown show, and Lutnick’s either in over his head or part of the game. Either way, the semiconductor world’s about to get rocked, and not in a good way.What do you all think? Are we headed for a crash? Is this insider trading staring us in the face?\n",

            "The Nasdaq 100 index is currently encountering strong resistance around the 19,000 level, signaling the end of its technical rebound phase. This pattern echoes past periods of bear market entry, offering investors clues to anticipate the market’s next moves. \n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, in January 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening triggered a sudden plunge in the Nasdaq 100, with the index dropping over 20% from its peak. A brief technical rebound followed, but it faced resistance near 15,000 and resumed its decline. A similar scenario unfolded in early March 2020, when the Nasdaq 100 fell 20% from its high, entering a bear market. The 8,800 level acted as a strong resistance, and although an emergency Fed rate cut spurred a rebound, the index soon plummeted again. The current situation bears striking similarities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Historically, entering a bear market often led to further declines. Yet, recent trends suggest this isn’t always the case. In March 2020, swift Fed rate cuts and quantitative easing propelled U.S. markets to new highs almost immediately. Another example is December 20, 2018, when the Nasdaq 100 dropped over 20% from its peak, entering a bear market, only to rebound quickly after Fed Chair Powell hinted at pausing rate hikes. These instances show how sensitive markets can be to policy interventions, sometimes defying expectations with rapid recoveries. However, with aggressive rate cuts like those in 2020 unlikely today, the possibility of further weakness in the Nasdaq remains a concern.\n",
            "\n",
            "Stock buybacks have long been a key driver of U.S. market gains, particularly for the Nasdaq. When Trump took office in 2017 and slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, companies redirected tax savings into buybacks. Apple, for example, ramped up its buybacks starting in 2018, spending $100 billion annually and boosting its stock price, pushing its market cap past $1 trillion that year. Recently, its market cap has neared $4 trillion, but the issue is that buyback amounts haven’t scaled significantly—remaining at $110 billion in 2024. Buying back $100 billion worth of stock when the market cap was under $1 trillion had a far greater impact than the same amount with a $3 trillion-plus valuation. To replicate past stock price surges, buybacks might need to reach $300 billion or more, yet there’s little indication of such an increase. This suggests that the effectiveness of buybacks in propping up stock prices is waning.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since 2017, beyond buybacks, the activation of the stock options market and the rise in leveraged ETF assets have fueled Nasdaq gains. A surge in open interest in options has driven hedging demand—say, a Tesla call option seller buying Tesla stock, positively impacting the cash market. Post-2020, the sharp increase in leveraged ETF assets has brought in fresh buying power, though it’s a double-edged sword. Korean investors, in particular, have amplified U.S. market volatility by heavily purchasing leveraged ETFs. While this can lift prices in the short term, it also heightens market instability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump’s policies are another critical factor. During his first term, tax cuts and surging buybacks drew global capital to U.S. markets, sparking a Nasdaq rally. In contrast, his second term’s excessive tariffs are reversing this trend, triggering capital outflows from both U.S. stocks and bonds. The persistent decline in the dollar index exacerbates this, adding uncertainty. Unlike in March 2020, when Trump stabilized markets with a tariff suspension, his current policies are themselves a risk, eroding investor confidence.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, as the Nasdaq’s technical rebound draws to a close, investors should approach the market with caution, informed by historical patterns and economic indicators. The diminishing impact of buybacks, heightened volatility from leveraged ETFs, and uncertainties tied to Trump’s policies point to potential downward pressure. Without significant Fed intervention, reviewing portfolio risks and leaning toward strategies that mitigate volatility seem prudent. **With signs of capital flight from U.S. markets emerging, flexibility in response could prove essential**.\n",

Is it a dumb play for long-term growth?\n",

Bond markets are flashing red, real 30-year yields now rival the panic levels seen after Lehman’s collapse. Even strong inflation data can’t paper over the chaos, as markets look past stats and earnings to the looming question: how will companies, and countries, navigate a world where the U.S. has torched economic diplomacy?

            "\n",
            "1. Current policy of the Trump administration is completely misguided, confused and, if continued, will inevitably lead to a major crash. Not just a market crash, but an economy crash. US is not in a position to internalize all production; it can’t happen, it won’t happen. We can maybe strangle the market enough to get some of production back, at a great cost to the consumer and with huge sacrifice to the level of life. This is what almost every economist understands, and this is why almost no one believed this is their real goal. Most economists do not believe anyone can be that misguided on the implications, and therefore we looked at it as a “negotiation technique” rather than a policy. Unfortunately, it looks more and more like this IS a policy. If so, markets will undoubtedly exert more and more pressure on the government, as they already do. And the weakest point is not the equity market, but the bond market. There’s very little anyone can do if bond market begins to crumble, because any attempt to artificially support it by the Fed will lead to other problems. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. If the plan is to hold negotiations, or if the plan is adjusted towards negotiations, we have a better chance to get out of it with minimal losses, but even then market crash is still a real possibility. First of all, trust in US government is already damaged, and it’s not coming back, not until the next administration, if ever. There are moves being made now by the major players, and they will not be reversed. It will become manifest in the economy weeks and months from now, affecting interest rates and unemployment levels. Nothing anyone can do to reverse this. Second, markets were overpriced even before the current madness, but there was a general belief they will hold despite common sense, since there was no particular reason for them to go down. Well, now they did go down. That logic no longer works. The boat has sailed, it’s not coming back to port. Even a complete, 100% reversal of this misguided policy is not going to bring us back to the situation before the Second Fools’ Day (also known as “Liberation from common sense” day).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. My personal strategy now is to shift everything into European bonds and inflation protected securities, as those are safest assets. I would not invest into stocks or bonds until the market has settled. It will probably take months, if not years, to see full effects. I would not keep too much $ cash either, because of the possibility that bank accounts will be frozen and exchange rates drop to the point that up to 50% of  US dollar value could be wiped out. FDIC insures nominal amount, not a real value. If you want to keep cash - look into a basket of currencies, including Swiss frank, Euro and Pound. Best if it’s held in a foreign bank, although there are problems with opening and holding foreign bank accounts for most people.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt;She alleges that Facebook created custom-built censorship tools for the CCP, which gave a “chief editor” extensive power over content moderation to the point that they could choose to shut off service completely in certain regions of China or on certain dates, like the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n",

            "\n",
            "&gt;Wynn-Williams’ testimony was highly anticipated. In March, she published a book about her time at Facebook called “Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.”\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt;The day after the book was published, Meta won an interim decision from an arbitrator, which said that Wynn-Williams violated a non-disparagement clause that she signed when she left the company. But Meta’s desire to limit the book’s reach seems to have had the opposite effect — now, the book is No. 2 on The New York Times Best Sellers list under non-fiction.\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt;Meta told TechCrunch that the arbitration order does not prohibit her from speaking to Congress and that the company does not intend to interfere with her legal rights. The company also said it’s not a secret that it does business in China.\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt;Toward the end of Wynn-Williams’ tenure in 2017, Facebook had launched a photo-sharing app called Colorful Balloons in China, as well as an app called Moments. Meta points out that this has been [previously reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/technology/facebook-china-moments-colorful-balloons.html) and that it discloses in government filings that it generates advertising revenue from China, even though its services like Facebook and Instagram are banned there.\n",

She said it is.\n",
            "\n",
            "&gt;“As part of the censorship tool that was developed, there were virality counters — so any time a piece of content got over 10,000 views, that would automatically trigger it being reviewed by what they called the chief editor,” she said. “What was particularly surprising is that the virality counters were not just installed, but activated in Hong Kong and also in Taiwan.”\n",
