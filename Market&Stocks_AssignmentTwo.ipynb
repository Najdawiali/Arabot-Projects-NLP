But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.\\n\\nNew levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of chips essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Semiconductor supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.\\n\\nThe administration\\u2019s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.\\n\\nTariffs would also be a blow to the world\\u2019s largest drugmakers, including Merck &amp; Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.\\n\\nTrump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers\\u2019 reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he\\u2019s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. The president has also vowed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and possibly critical minerals.\\n\\nUnder Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.\\n\\nTrump has cast reshoring chipmaking and revitalizing the US industrial base as essential for the nation\\u2019s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work work.\\n\\n**Worldwide Impact**\\n\\nThe move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (\\u20ac47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump\\u2019s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country\\u2019s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship drugs to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.\\n\\nThe US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.\\n\\nNearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they\\u2019d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they\\u2019d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.\\n\\n\\u201cRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,\\u201d BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. \\u201cIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.\\u201d\\n\\n**Trump\\u2019s Exemptions**\\n\\nThe US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.\\n\\nThe announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,\\u201d Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. \\u201cAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, \\u2018Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,\\u2019 then he\\u2019s absolutely willing to listen. And if he\\u2019s convinced, then he\\u2019ll make the call to do something like he did today.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.\",\n          \"Scott Bessent wants to propose that [trading partners are to limit China\\u2019s involvement in their economies in exchange for concessions on reciprocal tariffs](https://archive.is/GxECZ#selection-2479.19-2479.153).\\n\\nI think this is a tough sell, specially after the \\\"Liberation Day\\\" fiasco and all the backtracking and about face that this administration has done so far on tariffs.

Sezzle targets younger, credit-conscious consumers and integrates with retailers to boost sales, earning revenue from merchant fees and, optionally, consumer interest on extended plans.

            "I think one of the best performing commodities this year will be Silver. The metal has a unique combination of industrial utility and precious metal appeal. Unlike gold, which is primarily a store of value, silver has extensive industrial demand, accounting for over 50% of its annual consumption. As of 2023, global silver demand reached approximately **1.2 billion ounces**, driven by sectors such as electronics, solar energy, automotive, and medical technology. Silver's conductivity makes it essential in everything from circuit boards and smartphones to electric vehicles and photovoltaic cells. Notably, demand from the solar industry alone hit a record **161 million ounces in 2023**, reflecting its critical role in the transition to renewable energy. This growing industrial need places upward pressure on prices, especially as global policies increasingly favor green technologies. The US might not be so green the next four years but the rest of the world certainly is. Samsung also recently had a break through in its solid state battery development that will use a silver-carbon layer, if others follow this could be a game changer for electric cars and their range. Samsung is set to start production this year. \n",
            "\n",
            "On the supply side, silver production has struggled to keep pace with rising demand. Global mine production in 2023 was about **820 million ounces**, creating a notable supply deficit. This marks several consecutive years of shortfall, leading to draw downs in above-ground inventories. Many silver-producing mines are aging, and new discoveries are becoming rarer and more expensive to develop. In addition to its industrial use, silver retains monetary value and is seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation—particularly attractive during times of economic uncertainty. This dual role, as both a commodity and a financial asset, makes silver a compelling addition to a diversified investment portfolio, Silver and Gold have always been paired together and the ratio has been way off recently. Gold has had a fantastic run this year which surprised everyone, even Warren Buffett probably. In 1998 Buffett announced he purchased 130M ounces of silver with the idea demand will pick up. He had the right idea but he was too early, electric cars, solar, batteries and cell phones weren't in their prime growth period. If central banks start adding silver to their vaults, watch out. \n",

            "SLR is a regulatory requirement that mandates banks to hold a certain amount of capital against their assets. Banks take customer deposits and either lend them out or invest in financial assets. Loans are regulated by the BIS ratio (Bank for International Settlements ratio), while financial assets fall under SLR. The BIS ratio requires banks to maintain at least 8% of their loan assets as capital, whereas SLR demands a minimum of 3% capital for non-loan assets. These rules are designed to prevent banks from taking on excessive risk. The 1997 Asian financial crisis, where many Korean banks collapsed due to unrecoverable loans, underscores why such safeguards matter.\n",
            "\n",
            "With long-term U.S. Treasury prices recently plummeting, financial authorities are considering easing SLR restrictions. In 2020, when long-term Treasury prices dropped sharply, regulators relaxed SLR, allowing banks to buy Treasuries and stabilize their prices. A similar conversation is happening now, with institutions like JPMorgan advocating for SLR relief to enable banks to purchase Treasuries. Should the Nasdaq face further declines, easing SLR could lower Treasury yields and provide a lift to the stock market.\n",

            "\n",
            "However, there’s a catch. Banks investing customer deposits in long-term Treasuries can face significant risks if interest rates rise. The 2023 U.S. regional banking crisis was a textbook example: 30-year Treasuries lost half their value from their peak, and when deposit withdrawals surged, banks lacked the liquidity to cover them. Short-term Treasuries, controlled by the Federal Reserve’s rate policies, pose less risk but offer minimal profit, making them less appealing to banks. **How banks handle long-term Treasuries thus becomes a critical factor in financial stability**.\n",
            "\n",
            "There’s also a misconception worth addressing: some believe Trump aims to boost Treasury demand via stablecoins. This is unlikely. Stablecoins primarily hold short-term Treasuries to maintain their pegged value. If they shifted to long-term Treasuries, they’d be vulnerable to rate swings, potentially destabilizing the cryptocurrency market. Short-term Treasury demand is already robust—Warren Buffett holds over $300 billion in them—but long-term Treasuries are the real challenge.\n",

            "# Tight Yield Spreads and Policy Uncertainty\n",
            "\n",
            "Currently, the yield spread between short- and long-term U.S. Treasuries is nearly nonexistent. The 3-month Treasury yields 4.372%, while the 30-year yields 4.771%. With such a narrow gap, investors favor short-term securities. For long-term Treasuries to attract significant buying, their yields would need to approach 7%. The Fed could widen this spread by cutting rates, boosting demand for long-term Treasuries, but inflation concerns and trade tariff risks make an immediate rate cut unlikely.\n",
            "\n",
            "if the Nasdaq teeters on the edge of a deeper plunge, financial authorities may ease SLR to depress long-term Treasury yields, offering a potential boost to U.S. equities. Investors should keep a close eye on regulatory shifts and monetary policy signals. In times of heightened volatility, chasing short-term trades might take a backseat to a longer-term approach that spreads risk across assets. Above all, **staying attuned to macroeconomic indicators like Fed decisions and inflation data will be key to navigating what lies ahead.**\n",

I believe Trump is telling the truth when he says they are talking with China at very high levels, because yesterday was the first indication he gave that they’re talking, before that it was always “we’re waiting for them to call us”.

These chips were lobotomized versions initially designed to comply with earlier export controls but are now subject to stricter licensing requirements under the Trump administration's policies. I'm mainly interested if NVDA breaks $100 to the downside. The semis industry is volatile due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, affecting AMD and INTC (not as much) as well.

            "Leverage ETFs offer a way to boost returns, but their risks can catch investors off guard in volatile markets. With global markets increasingly influenced by unpredictable factors like trade wars and political instability, the allure of quick profits from leverage ETFs can be tempting. However, Volatility can offer opportunities for significant gains, but it can also lead to devastating losses if investors are unprepared for the magnified downturns.\n",
            "\n",
            "# What Are Leverage ETFs?\n",
            "\n",
            "Leverage ETFs are investment vehicles that combine stocks and futures, aiming to track the daily returns of an underlying asset by a multiple of two or more. In the U.S., where the options market outshines the stock futures market, leverage ETFs rely on synthetic futures rather than actual futures. A synthetic future is constructed by buying a call option and selling a put option with the same strike price, mimicking the behavior of a futures contract. These transactions are facilitated through swap agreements, specifically Total Return Swaps (TRS), enabling the ETF to pursue leveraged returns on the underlying asset\n",
            "\n",
            "# How Daily Rebalancing Works\n",
            "\n",
            "A defining trait of leverage ETFs is their mandate to deliver at least double the daily return of the underlying asset. This requires constant adjustment of their synthetic futures positions in response to price changes. For instance, if Tesla’s stock plummets by 50% on December 18, 2024, TSLL—a leverage ETF tracking Tesla—would see its value approach zero if it failed to adjust its holdings. To avoid this, TSLL must reduce its synthetic futures position when Tesla’s price drops and increase it when the price rises, ensuring the daily 2x leverage target is met.\n",
            "\n",
            "This adjustment process may not pose significant issues in short-term scenarios involving sharp declines followed by swift recoveries. Take 2022 as an example: a market crash followed by a rapid rebound limits the losses from rebalancing, keeping the \"negative compounding effect\" in check. In such cases, the erosion of the ETF’s value remains less pronounced.\n",
            "\n",
            "# Risks in Volatile Markets\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the story shifts dramatically in volatile, range-bound markets. If Tesla’s stock oscillates daily with 10% gains and losses, TSLL must buy additional synthetic futures on up days and sell them on down days. This pattern of buying high and selling low repeats, swiftly eroding the ETF’s value.\n",
            "\n",
            "This mirrors how a leverage ETF reduces its synthetic futures exposure as the underlying asset declines. Unlike stocks, which can simply be held, leverage ETFs must actively manage futures positions, making them more vulnerable in prolonged downturns. If the synthetic futures’ leverage ratio reaches 20x, selling futures becomes critical to maintain the daily 2x tracking—failure to do so undermines the ETF’s objective.\n",
            "\n",
            "# Volatility, Time Decay, and Investment Strategy\n",
            "\n",
            "Option pricing, governed by the Black-Scholes model, hinges on volatility as a key determinant. While stock investors may not view volatility as embedded in price, options introduce the concept of time value. Leverage ETFs, utilizing options within synthetic futures, are thus subject to time decay. When the underlying asset moves sideways, this cost steadily chips away at returns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consequently, leverage ETFs hold the most promise in short-term, trending markets where clear directionality can amplify gains. In contrast, volatile, directionless markets amplify losses, underscoring the need for careful market analysis before investing. A focus on short-term strategies rather than long-term holding, coupled with an awareness of volatility’s impact, may offer a more prudent path for those considering these instruments.\n",

            "Alright, Reddit, buckle up because we’re diving into the absolute rollercoaster that is Trump’s tariff policy on semiconductors, spearheaded by his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This is a wild ride of mixed signals, market swings, and what smells like blatant manipulation to make billionaires richer while the rest of us get played. If you’re in the markets or just curious about how the sausage gets made in DC, you need to read this. Monday’s announcement is going to be a doozy, and I’m calling it now: we’re staring down a potential disaster for the semiconductor industry, a textbook bull trap, and some seriously shady insider trading vibes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s start with the Friday bombshell. On April 11, 2025, the **Trump administration** dropped a *memo* that had Wall Street doing cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and a bunch of other electronics were exempted from the massive “reciprocal” tariffs Trump slapped on China (we’re talking 125% levies—insane). The U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, and flat panel displays, all getting a free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, and NVIDIA went nuts. The S&amp;P 500 was already down 10% since Trump took office, so this felt like a lifeline. Futures soared, X was buzzing with “bull market confirmed” takes, and everyone thought we were headed for a recovery rally. I mean, who wouldn’t be bullish? It looked like Trump was giving Big Tech a massive break.\n",
            "\n",
            "But then, Sunday morning hits, and **Howard Lutnick** goes on ABC’s This Week and basically says, **“Psych!”** He clarified that those exemptions? Yeah, they’re *temporary.* Semiconductors and electronics are still getting hit with **“sector-specific”** tariffs in **“a month or two,”** tied to national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These aren’t negotiable, unlike the reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick’s exact words: “These are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.” Suddenly, the whole narrative flips. The Friday exemption wasn’t a win—it was a head fake. And now, Monday’s announcement is looming, where Trump’s expected to double down on these semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos for the industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s talk about why this is a big deal for semiconductors. The global chip supply chain is insanely complex. Most semiconductors are designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), and assembled or finished in places like China. If Trump slaps tariffs on chips coming from China—or worse, starts a national security probe that messes with the whole supply chain—prices are going to spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm are going to take a hit, not to mention downstream players like Apple, who assemble iPhones in China. Lutnick’s pushing this “re-shore to America” narrative, but building chip fabs in the U.S. takes years and billions of dollars. TSMC’s Arizona plant isn’t even fully online yet! In the meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, and consumers get stuck with pricier gadgets—or straight-up shortages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let’s get to the bull trap. Friday’s exemption announcement was like **catnip for traders.** Everyone piled into tech stocks, thinking the tariff threat was gone. But Lutnick’s Sunday comments yanked the rug out. Posts on X were already screaming about it: “Yesterday’s exemptions weren’t surrender—they were a setup,” one user said. Another called it a “headline-driven market” where the administration is “steering price action.” If Monday’s announcement confirms heavy tariffs, those bullish bets from Friday are going to get crushed. We could see a brutal sell-off in semiconductor stocks, dragging the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 down with it. The market’s already been a mess—wildest swings since COVID, down 10% since January 20. This could be the trap that catches all the dip-buyers off guard.\n",
            "\n",
            "And here’s where it gets really ugly: the insider trading and market manipulation angle. Let’s rewind to April 9, when Trump posted on Truth Social, **“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,”** just hours before he announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries (except China). The S&amp;P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, and Trump Media’s stock shot up 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters aren’t buying it. They’re calling for SEC investigations, saying Trump’s post reeks of insider trading. Schiff’s letter to the White House asked who knew about the tariff pause beforehand and whether anyone traded on it. When Trump was asked when he decided on the pause, he was cagey: “Over the last few days… probably came together early this morning.” Yeah, right.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fast forward to this weekend’s semiconductor flip-flop, and it’s déjà vu. Friday’s exemption pumps the market, Lutnick’s Sunday reversal sets up a crash, and Monday’s announcement could be the knockout punch. The timing is too convenient. Billionaires like Bill Ackman, who’s been cozy with Trump but criticized tariffs, are probably sitting pretty, knowing the playbook. Meanwhile, retail traders who went all-in on Friday are about to get smoked. It’s not just Trump’s Truth Social posts—Lutnick’s been all over TV, hyping tariffs one day, backtracking the next. The mixed signals aren’t just chaotic; they’re starting to look deliberate. As one X post put it, “The biggest rally of the year would come on the day Lutnick gets fired.” That’s the vibe right now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why does this matter? Because semiconductors are the backbone of everything. Your phone, your car, your fridge—they all need chips. If Trump and Lutnick tank the industry with tariffs, it’s not just stock prices that suffer. Inflation’s already a worry (economists have been screaming about tariffs spiking prices), and chip shortages could make 2021’s supply chain mess look like a picnic. Plus, China’s not sitting still—they hiked their own tariffs to 125% on Friday and are “evaluating” Trump’s exemptions. This could spiral into a full-blown trade war, and guess who pays the price? Not the billionaires with their offshore accounts—us.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, what’s the play here? Brace yourself. Monday’s announcement could confirm tariffs that gut semiconductor stocks and ripple through tech. If you’re holding NVIDIA or TSMC, maybe hedge with some puts. Cash is king if the market tanks. And keep an eye on X and Truth Social—Trump’s posts are basically market signals now, legal or not. The bigger picture? This administration’s tariff policy is a clown show, and Lutnick’s either in over his head or part of the game. Either way, the semiconductor world’s about to get rocked, and not in a good way.What do you all think? Are we headed for a crash? Is this insider trading staring us in the face?\n",

            "The Nasdaq 100 index is currently encountering strong resistance around the 19,000 level, signaling the end of its technical rebound phase. This pattern echoes past periods of bear market entry, offering investors clues to anticipate the market’s next moves. \n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, in January 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening triggered a sudden plunge in the Nasdaq 100, with the index dropping over 20% from its peak. A brief technical rebound followed, but it faced resistance near 15,000 and resumed its decline. A similar scenario unfolded in early March 2020, when the Nasdaq 100 fell 20% from its high, entering a bear market. The 8,800 level acted as a strong resistance, and although an emergency Fed rate cut spurred a rebound, the index soon plummeted again. The current situation bears striking similarities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Historically, entering a bear market often led to further declines. Yet, recent trends suggest this isn’t always the case. In March 2020, swift Fed rate cuts and quantitative easing propelled U.S. markets to new highs almost immediately. Another example is December 20, 2018, when the Nasdaq 100 dropped over 20% from its peak, entering a bear market, only to rebound quickly after Fed Chair Powell hinted at pausing rate hikes. These instances show how sensitive markets can be to policy interventions, sometimes defying expectations with rapid recoveries. However, with aggressive rate cuts like those in 2020 unlikely today, the possibility of further weakness in the Nasdaq remains a concern.\n",
            "\n",
            "Stock buybacks have long been a key driver of U.S. market gains, particularly for the Nasdaq. When Trump took office in 2017 and slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, companies redirected tax savings into buybacks. Apple, for example, ramped up its buybacks starting in 2018, spending $100 billion annually and boosting its stock price, pushing its market cap past $1 trillion that year. Recently, its market cap has neared $4 trillion, but the issue is that buyback amounts haven’t scaled significantly—remaining at $110 billion in 2024. Buying back $100 billion worth of stock when the market cap was under $1 trillion had a far greater impact than the same amount with a $3 trillion-plus valuation. To replicate past stock price surges, buybacks might need to reach $300 billion or more, yet there’s little indication of such an increase. This suggests that the effectiveness of buybacks in propping up stock prices is waning.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since 2017, beyond buybacks, the activation of the stock options market and the rise in leveraged ETF assets have fueled Nasdaq gains. A surge in open interest in options has driven hedging demand—say, a Tesla call option seller buying Tesla stock, positively impacting the cash market. Post-2020, the sharp increase in leveraged ETF assets has brought in fresh buying power, though it’s a double-edged sword. Korean investors, in particular, have amplified U.S. market volatility by heavily purchasing leveraged ETFs. While this can lift prices in the short term, it also heightens market instability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump’s policies are another critical factor. During his first term, tax cuts and surging buybacks drew global capital to U.S. markets, sparking a Nasdaq rally. In contrast, his second term’s excessive tariffs are reversing this trend, triggering capital outflows from both U.S. stocks and bonds. The persistent decline in the dollar index exacerbates this, adding uncertainty. Unlike in March 2020, when Trump stabilized markets with a tariff suspension, his current policies are themselves a risk, eroding investor confidence.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, as the Nasdaq’s technical rebound draws to a close, investors should approach the market with caution, informed by historical patterns and economic indicators. The diminishing impact of buybacks, heightened volatility from leveraged ETFs, and uncertainties tied to Trump’s policies point to potential downward pressure. Without significant Fed intervention, reviewing portfolio risks and leaning toward strategies that mitigate volatility seem prudent. **With signs of capital flight from U.S. markets emerging, flexibility in response could prove essential**.\n",

Bond markets are flashing red, real 30-year yields now rival the panic levels seen after Lehman’s collapse.

            "\n",
            "1. Current policy of the Trump administration is completely misguided, confused and, if continued, will inevitably lead to a major crash. Not just a market crash, but an economy crash. US is not in a position to internalize all production; it can’t happen, it won’t happen. We can maybe strangle the market enough to get some of production back, at a great cost to the consumer and with huge sacrifice to the level of life. This is what almost every economist understands, and this is why almost no one believed this is their real goal. Most economists do not believe anyone can be that misguided on the implications, and therefore we looked at it as a “negotiation technique” rather than a policy. Unfortunately, it looks more and more like this IS a policy. If so, markets will undoubtedly exert more and more pressure on the government, as they already do. And the weakest point is not the equity market, but the bond market. There’s very little anyone can do if bond market begins to crumble, because any attempt to artificially support it by the Fed will lead to other problems. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. If the plan is to hold negotiations, or if the plan is adjusted towards negotiations, we have a better chance to get out of it with minimal losses, but even then market crash is still a real possibility. First of all, trust in US government is already damaged, and it’s not coming back, not until the next administration, if ever. There are moves being made now by the major players, and they will not be reversed. It will become manifest in the economy weeks and months from now, affecting interest rates and unemployment levels. Nothing anyone can do to reverse this. Second, markets were overpriced even before the current madness, but there was a general belief they will hold despite common sense, since there was no particular reason for them to go down. Well, now they did go down. That logic no longer works. The boat has sailed, it’s not coming back to port. Even a complete, 100% reversal of this misguided policy is not going to bring us back to the situation before the Second Fools’ Day (also known as “Liberation from common sense” day).\n",

            "3. My personal strategy now is to shift everything into European bonds and inflation protected securities, as those are safest assets. I would not invest into stocks or bonds until the market has settled. It will probably take months, if not years, to see full effects. I would not keep too much $ cash either, because of the possibility that bank accounts will be frozen and exchange rates drop to the point that up to 50% of  US dollar value could be wiped out. FDIC insures nominal amount, not a real value. If you want to keep cash - look into a basket of currencies, including Swiss frank, Euro and Pound. Best if it’s held in a foreign bank, although there are problems with opening and holding foreign bank accounts for most people.\n",

            "The U.S. financial markets are witnessing an unusual phenomenon: the price of 30-year Treasury futures has crashed, driving yields up from 4.3% to 4.8%.\n",
            "\n",
            "This surge in long-term yields, despite a high likelihood of short-term rate cuts, defies conventional economic theory. Concurrently, President Trump’s decision to delay imposing tariffs is deeply tied to this market instability.\n",
            "\n",
            "The spike in long-term yields has been attributed to hedge funds’ basis trading. This arbitrage strategy capitalizes on price discrepancies between futures and cash bonds, buying undervalued assets (cash Treasuries) and selling overvalued ones (Treasury futures).\n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout 2024, hedge funds ramped up short positions in Treasury futures, selling overvalued futures and purchasing undervalued cash bonds. They financed this by borrowing cash bonds in the RP market, using the proceeds to repeat the cycle of shorting futures and buying cash bonds. The SOFR rate (a key overnight RP rate) is a critical metric in this process.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trouble emerged when Treasury futures prices surged (yields dropped) recently, driven by recession fears and expectations of rate cuts. This inflicted significant losses on hedge funds’ short positions, prompting exchanges to demand additional margin. Unable to meet these calls, hedge funds were forced to unwind their trades.\n",
            "\n",
            "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed excessive leverage by hedge funds for amplifying this volatility. This underscores that basis trading isn’t a foolproof hedge—losses in futures require continuous margin funding, destabilizing the market further.\n",
            "\n",
            "The U.S. stock market is America’s Achilles’ heel. Its excessive bubble hampers the nation’s ability to compete with rivals like China. Treasury Secretary Bessent has stressed that “it’s time for Main Street (the real economy) to thrive,” advocating a shift from Wall Street-centric policies to bolstering the real economy.\n",

            "China, with minimal financial bubbles, maintains a stable Shanghai Composite and weathers tariff wars with resilience. Conversely, the U.S. must deflate its stock market bubble to regain long-term competitiveness.

Of course, if China sees an economic reason to give into tariffs, it could be worth conceding, but I'm just a little doubtful that Xi, who again, is basically a dictator, would feel enough pressure that he would ever take a bad deal from a guy like Trump, who probably is not very flexible.\n",

            "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s trip to see President Xi Jinping will offer a chance to swap notes on a common problem: how to respond to an increasingly unreliable US.\n",
            "Sanchez, who is due in Beijing on Friday, will be the first European leader to visit China since President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on most of the world. With agreements due to be signed in areas including pharmaceuticals, agricultural and medical products, Sanchez can argue that Spain is the go-to partner for China in Europe at a time of growing economic\n",
            "\n",
            "For his part, Xi is unlikely to neglect making the case that Beijing is a more dependable ally to Europe than Washington these days. The result is an opportunity for both to champion closer ties as their respective US relations come under severe strain.\n",
            "“One of the best ways to fight the tariff threat is by strengthening all sorts of relations and, in trade, China can play a huge role,” said Cristina Gallach, a former deputy Spanish foreign minister and United Nations Under-Secretary-General. For Sanchez, she said, this “makes the trip not only timely, but also smart.”\n",
            "In a briefing to reporters before landing in Hanoi, Sanchez said that the European Union needs to change its stance toward China, and China toward Europe, saying that Spain can play a role as a builder of more balanced alliances between the two. The situation with the US under Trump calls for everyone to adapt and see how trade relations are balanced, he added.\n",
            "Last year, Sanchez criticized EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and since then he’s secured billions of euros in investment in battery production, renewable energy and an electric vehicle plant. His visit promises new or increased Chinese investments in the same spheres.\n",
            "As one person familiar with the thinking in Madrid put it, the EU and Spain both regard China as a partner, competitor and rival. Spain, however, focuses more on China as a partner, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing sensitive diplomatic matters.\n",
            "The trip, via Vietnam, will be his third to China in two years and, from the Spanish government’s perspective, the fact that Sanchez has met three times with Xi is evidence that Beijing sees Spain as an important partner.\n",
            "But there is a wider goal. Part of Sanchez’s strategy is about pushing Europe to craft a relationship with China that is independent of its US ties, according to a second person who also requested anonymity to speak freely. That means not simply bowing to Washington’s demands to wall off China.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "A similar point is made by Chinese officials, who explain away any European criticism as being directed by the US. In an op-ed in the state-backed Global Times published March 31, Zhao Junjie, a senior research fellow at the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, painted Sanchez’s visit as part of an EU change of “mindset” that is to be encouraged away from the Trump administration and toward China.\n",
            "“The growing rifts with the US, the escalation of trade conflicts and the decline in political mutual trust have all caused considerable anxiety among EU decision makers,” wrote Zhao. “As a result, maintaining close economic ties with China has inevitably become a strategic option for the EU and its member states when the transatlantic relationship is fracturing.”\n",
            "The extent to which the 53-year-old Spaniard will be able to shape EU policy is unclear. Views toward China have hardened in most capitals since the pandemic, with Xi’s refusal to condemn Russian leader Vladimir Putin over Moscow’s war on Ukraine causing deeper damage still.\n",
            "Italy pulled out of Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative in late 2023 as the hoped-for economic gains failed to materialize. And while Sanchez wants more business with Beijing, Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has warned domestic companies against making bigger investments in China.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sanchez is in any case something of an outlier in Europe. One of just a handful of center-left leaders in the EU — a dwindling band that will become smaller once Olaf Scholz steps down in Germany — Sanchez is out of step with most of the bloc in more than just his political colors.\n",
            "He’s adamantly pro-migration at a time when his counterparts are tightening up the borders. He’s a defense spending laggard, since military strength isn’t seen as a vote winner in Spain, leaving him with the smallest defense budget in NAT0 relative to economic size.\n",
            "Sanchez “seeks to be a leader of Social Democracy in the 21st century, defending the role of the state as a driver of the economy, defending equality, green policies, and multilateralism,” said Cristina Monge, a politics professor at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.\n",
            "Yet his focus on the green transition at a time when the Trump administration is undermining global efforts to tackle climate change could also be seen as swimming against the political tide. All the same, it’s another reason that the government is working on its relationship with China and keen for more investments, the first person said.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s already a key area for Spain: in December alone, Chinese carmaker Chery opened an EV plant near Barcelona in partnership with a local firm; China Three Gorges announced it was buying one of Spain’s largest solar farms; and CATL, the world’s largest EV battery maker, said it would team up with Stellantis to build a €4.1 billion plant.\n",
            "His policy focus on energy and clean technologies equates to bolstering security, and so “the China visit fits within the European Union’s idea of strategic autonomy,” maintained Monge.\n",
            "Despite leading a series of increasingly fragile coalitions during almost seven years in power, he’s delivered the fastest economic growth of any major EU economy, helped by strong immigration.\n",
            "Madrid also sees building ties to China as a way to increase influence in Africa and Latin America, regions where Beijing has gained traction in recent years. Africa in particular is coming more into focus for Spain as a result of shifting migration patterns, with increased numbers of people making for the Canary Islands adding to flows along the direct route across the Mediterranean.\n",
            "Unlike other European governments, Sanchez has sought to create legal schemes to enable the arrival of foreign workers, leading to clashes with the opposition. Yet China policy is broadly shared across Spain’s political spectrum.\n",
            "“This is very interesting for Beijing,” said Mario Esteban, who heads the Eastern Asian Research Centre at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. “This allows China to see Spain as a stable, medium-term partner and one of the major EU countries — an opportunity.”\n",
